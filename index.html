            <h3>Seoul, the city where the new embraces the old</h3>
            <p>
              Seoul is riding a wave of creativity. From fashion to food,
              architecture to art, the city has become a creative haven for
              those looking to make their mark. It's packed with trendsetting
              residents who have helped create a future-proof city that still
              honors its distinctive past. Temples and skyscrapers mingle across
              the city while acclaimed chefs fuse bygone dishes with tasty new
              trends in South Korea's famed cuisine. It truly is a city built
              for the curious, for those who don't like to stand still.
            </p>

              Seoul is the ideal base for exploring all South Korea has to
              offer. It takes just an hour by plane to reach the city of Busan,
              the Miami of South Korea, and Jeju Island, which is famed for its
              sun-kissed beaches and volcanic landscapes. Youâ€™ll also benefit
              from excellent transport links to the famous Hwaseong Fortress (a
              UNESCO World Heritage Site in Suwon), Pocheon Art Valley (an
              idyllic park complex), and Mangswolsa Mountain Temple (an ancient
              Buddhist temple in the Namhansanseong Fortress).
